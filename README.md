# Microsoft 365 - Copilot Agents Collection

My collection of M365 Agents that have been built with either Copilot Studio or Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit. Many of these will be destined for Copilot Pro Dev Samples Gallery

Note: The way Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit works, you will need to load a subfolder for the agent as the root folder in Visual Studio Code otherwise the toolkit does not properly initialise - it does not support multiple agents seperately.
